# phonebook 

The app has 3 parts:
1)	Front end done with  angular with redux store + ngrx
2)	Web api done with .net core
3)	Backend Sql entity framework core
To see the app working, run the web api first and then the front end which is independent of the backend
The database is created using code first approach


For the Front End
run npm install
followed by ng serve
